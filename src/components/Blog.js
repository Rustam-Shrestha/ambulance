        Our world Earth is very different from other planets in this solar
        system, one of the most beautiful peaceful planet where life is possible
        with favourable elements which is almost impossible to find in other
        planet we humans are destroying our own habitat. As a matter of fact our
        earth has more amount of trees than the the stars in the whole Milkyway
        galaxy they help us in everyway that we can't even imagine.
        <br /> Apart from giving us firewood, wood for construction, woods for
        furnture items it is saving our life. Even though amount of trees are
        more than stars in our galaxy that doesn't mean trees are unlimited.
        almost all people have forgot the main importance of trees. They cut
        down the trees as a furniture items,
        <br />
        construction items and so forth hence all leads to money. This has taken
        light away from it's essential for keeping environment balanced, prevent
        flood, landslide, land infertility, desertification of land and much
        more. Apart from money value of trees are unexplainable. Forests are
        converted into settlement area and agricultural area. This proves human
        stupidity, they are digging their own grave. Forest are primary source
        of energy in some countries, but if we were to continue this trend in
        future global warming will take over the world which will directly
        affect whole ecosystem negatively. Acid rain, flood, landslide, UV ray
        <br />
        prevailance,temperature rise and different negative impacts makes our
        earth like other planets some negative effects are blatantly seen like:
        temperature rise, constant flood, untimely rainfall, climate change, sea
        level rising up and they are prevailing rapidly. Even though signs are
        vivid no one is giving their attention for this burning issue.
        <br />
        If this problem remains unseen our future generations will not be able
        to see a single tree. What's more? humans probably may get extinct like
        Dinosaurs one day(due to no food production —infertility of soil due to
        desertification of land—, global warming, sea level rising...,...) and
        this is a serious matter to be looked at.
